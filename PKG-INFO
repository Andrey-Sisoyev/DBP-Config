Name: Config
Description: 
      Configuration management module for PostgreSQL applications. 
      Store config parameters for your 
      configurable entities, manage constraints and defaults for them. 
      Automatic configurations check control, determining, whether 
      configuration is correct and ready to be used in real system.
      -------
      The read/write operations are not implemented very optimal, especially
      when automatic comletness checking is enabled. The system 
      is configurable to be fast, if this feature is disabled.
      Anyway, system isn't very fast, but it has more than enough speed 
      for good nonbison configuration management for your system with no 
      thousands of interconnected configs 
      and not thousands per second of queries to configs. 
      The code optimizations will be considered in further versions.
      Also, cycles are restricted in relations of type superconfig-subconfig.
      Enabling cycles support will be considered in further versions.
